There are 3 relevant files in the Reepository:

 - setup.sh
 - task1.ipynb
 - task2.ipynb

To rerun the results in the python notebooks, run the setup.sh to install the required packahges using 

`bash setup.sh`

Create a folder called data in the root directory with the CSVs provided in the zip file.

The directory structure should look like the following:

./\
├── data/\
│   ├── resale-flat-prices-based-on-approval-date-1990-1999.csv\
│   ├── resale-flat-prices-based-on-approval-date-2000-feb-2012.csv\
│   ├── resale-flat-prices-based-on-registration-date-from-jan-2015-to-dec-2016.csv\
│   ├── resale-flat-prices-based-on-registration-date-from-jan-2017-onwards.csv\
│   └── resale-flat-prices-based-on-registration-date-from-mar-2012-to-dec-2014.csv\
├── requirements.txt\
├── setup.sh*\
├── task1.ipynb\
└── task2.ipynb

Once this is completed, you should be able to run the python notebooks as you wish. Further explanation of decisions made as well as the analysis are handled inside the notebooks themselves.
